## Some of my projects

I've linked a few repositories below that I've worked on. Over time I'll also be adding more personal projects to [my website](https://projects.8bitsqu.id/) as a way to practice writing / documenting my work.

- [MIPS CPU Project, Imperial Y2 Winter Term](https://github.com/supleed2/ELEC50010-IAC-CW/): Working, synthesizable MIPS-compatible CPU, with memory-mapped I/O and peripherals, supporting the Intel Avalon memory interface
- [Mars Rover Project, Imperial Y2 Summer Term](https://github.com/supleed2/ELEC50003-P1-CW/): Group project to design and build an autonomous rover including subsystems for motion, power management and control / communication
- [Pet Tracker Project, Imperial Y3 Autumn Term](https://github.com/supleed2/ELEC60013-ES-CW1/): Pet Tracker using the FindMy Network as a backbone to provide basic data return from onboard sensors and ultra-low-power location tracking
- [Synthesizer Project, Imperial Y3 Spring Term](https://github.com/supleed2/ELEC60013-ES-CW2/): Firmware for a single-octave synthesizer, written in C++, with multiple waveforms and more octaves usable by connecting multiple together
- [FPGA Accelerator for StackSynth, Imperial Y4 Final Project](https://github.com/supleed2/EIE4-FYP): Accelerator board for the `Synthesizer Project` above, using an OrangeCrab to produce audio samples with a much greater number of oscillators
- [SystemVerilog VSCode Language Client Extension](https://github.com/dalance/svls-vscode/): A VSCode extension designed to work with the [svls](https://github.com/dalance/svls/) language server and provide in-editor feedback, as well as snippets and syntax highlighting for SystemVerilog files
